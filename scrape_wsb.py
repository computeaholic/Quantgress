"""Scrape r/wallstreetbets ticker mentions + FinBERT sentiment into DuckDB.

Phase 21 of Quantgress, and the second phase (after Phase 14 pageviews) that
is an *attention* signal rather than a disclosure record. Treat it the same
way: logged and queryable, not a strategy. The vault's own testing of exactly
this data -- [[Reddit WSB Sentiment Trading Bot - Oxford Paper Findings]] --
found that every mention- and sentiment-based strategy lost money once a
look-ahead bug was fixed (full-year 2025: -49%). Nothing here feeds
networth.py or any derived signal, and it should not.

Two things this does NOT do, deliberately:
  * No entities.py hookup. The ticker comes straight out of the post text by
    regex, like the bot in that write-up did -- there is no company name to
    resolve, so the resolution engine has nothing to add. What it needs
    instead is a stoplist (see STOPWORDS): the known failure of that bot was
    "tech", "bull" and "meme" matching real ETF tickers.
  * No sentiment column on any other table, and no join into `trades`.

Usage:
    py scrape_wsb.py --selftest              # offline checks, no network, no model
    py scrape_wsb.py                          # last 2 days of /new, scored
    py scrape_wsb.py --days 7 --pages 10      # wider walk
    py scrape_wsb.py --no-sentiment           # mention counts only, skips FinBERT
    py scrape_wsb.py --subreddit stocks

Resumable: every post id actually scored goes in `wsb_posts`, and re-running
adds only unseen posts, folding their counts into the existing (date, ticker)
row rather than replacing it. So a day's totals grow across runs instead of
being overwritten by whatever the last walk happened to see.

Reddit's /new listing only pages back 1000 posts (a hard cap on every listing
endpoint, not a flag this script sets), which on r/wallstreetbets is roughly
two days. A gap longer than that is not recoverable from this endpoint --
run it daily.

Credentials are approval-gated, unlike every other key in this project:
Reddit's Responsible Builder Policy requires explicit approval before any
API access at all. https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/42728983564564-Responsible-Builder-Policy
That same policy bars sharing or commercializing Reddit data, which is why
nothing here stores post text, titles, usernames or served post ids -- only
per-day, per-ticker counts and a mean score. Keep it that way.

"""Corporate jet flight tracking: FAA aircraft registry + OpenSky flight history.

Phase 20 of Quantgress. The premise Quiver sells as "Corporate Flights": a
company's jet showing up at an airport it never visits is a movement signal
(site visit, plant tour, counterparty HQ) that lands before any filing does.

Two halves, two tables, one view:

  aircraft   FAA Releasable Aircraft Database (MASTER.txt), filtered to
             corporate jets -- registrant is a corporation/LLC, airframe is a
             fixed-wing multi-engine turbojet/turbofan. ~24k rows. The FAA
             publishes the registrant NAME, which is the whole point: it maps
             a transponder hex code to "EXXON MOBIL CORP". entities.py fills
             owner_ticker_guess from there.
  flights    OpenSky Network /flights/aircraft -- one row per takeoff/landing
             pair, with the estimated departure and arrival ICAO airport.
  corp_flights  the view you query: flights joined to their owner.

Public-data status is the same as every other phase for the registry half:
MASTER.txt is a U.S. government publication, no auth, no terms to accept.
OpenSky is not government data -- it's a community ADS-B network, free for
non-commercial/research use with an account. It is the one dependency here
that is not public domain; read their terms before doing anything commercial
with the flights table.

Usage:
    py scrape_flights.py --selftest              # offline checks, no network
    py scrape_flights.py --registry              # (re)load the FAA registry
    py scrape_flights.py --flights                       # top 25 jets, last 7 days
    py scrape_flights.py --flights --owner EXXON         # one owner's fleet
    py scrape_flights.py --flights --icao24 a004b4 --days 30
    py scrape_flights.py --flights --limit 100 --days 2  # widen, mind the credits

Resumable: every (icao24, day) actually queried is recorded in flight_scans,
so a re-run costs nothing for days already covered -- including days that came
back empty, which is most of them for a jet that flies twice a month.

OpenSky credentials are required -- /flights/aircraft 403s anonymous requests
outright (confirmed live; the endpoint is not merely rate-limited without an
account). Create a free API client at https://opensky-network.org/my-opensky and
put OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID / OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET in .env next to the USPTO and FEC
keys. Only --flights needs them; --registry is pure FAA and needs nothing.

# ponytail: one calendar day per request, not the 2-day maximum the endpoint
# allows. OpenSky charges 4-960 credits per flight query depending on how many
# day partitions it crosses, and a standard account gets 4,000/day -- a 1-day
# window is the cheapest possible unit, and it makes the resume log a plain
# (icao24, day) pair instead of interval arithmetic. Batching two days per call
# would halve the request count and roughly double the per-call cost. Not worth
# the resume complexity.

# ponytail: --limit defaults to 25 aircraft, not the whole 24k registry.
# 24,662 jets x 7 days is 172k requests and ~690k credits against a 4,000/day
# budget -- a full sweep is a multi-month backfill, not a run. Scope it with
# --owner/--icao24 to a fleet you actually care about, or raise --limit
# knowing what it costs.
